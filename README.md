Programming challenge for counting the score in a bowling game

# Task

Your task is to sum up and output one player's score in a game of 10-pin bowling after a game of up to 21 rolls.

# Scoring

After each round the number of pins knocked down in that round is counted into the final score. If a player knocks down all ten pins in the first roll of a round, this is a strike, and the round is over. Otherwise, the round lasts for one more roll. If the second roll of a round knocks down all the remaining pins, this is a spare.

For each strike there is a bonus equal to the sum of pins knocked down in the two next rolls. For each spare there is a bonus equal to the numer of pins knocked down in the next roll.

The 10th and final round, the player may be granted extra rolls: In case of a strike, the player gets two more rolls to make up his strike bonus. In case of a spare, the player gets one more roll.

# Input

Your input will consist of a string defining a (valid) game of bowling.

The rolls are represented as a sequence of integers. Each integer corresponds to the number of pins that were knocked down in that roll.

`score("4 3 8 2 7 1 10 7 3 0 10 2 2 10 10 5 4")` should return `131`.

`score("10 10 9 1 7 3 2 7 10 1 9 10 7 1 10 10 10")` should return `183`.

# Output

Your output should be the total score of the game. Just print to stdout.

# Hand-in

* Source code (preferably Python or JavaScript)
* Some tests showing that it works
* Short assessment of the code quality, what could be better
